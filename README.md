It's a college final project and it still has a lot to optimize, 
but since the end of the semester has passed (of course you can think I'm lazy), 
I didn't optimize it and put it on GitHub today, hoping to help find the final project to attract college students, 
but don't forget that it's just a Java Swing project, it doesn't work for your graduation project, it can only be used as a semester final project.
